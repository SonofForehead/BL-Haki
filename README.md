BL Haki!! It'll include Conquerors Haki and Armament Haki. I think Observation Haki would work by showing a line of where the NPC will go, and I might add it in an update, but for now, I'm releasing it with just Armament Haki and Conquerors Haki.


Bugs/Features to be added:
- ~~TAKEDAMAGE(-9999f) plays the audio of the player getting hurt about 962362 times~~
- Global Volume
- ControllerInput
- Armament Haki
